        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline, internal, and external.</li>
        <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
        <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>External allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>Separation of concerns is a term that refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
        <li>A CSS rule is made up of a "selector" and "declorations" property: value; property: value; etc.</li>
        <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box, the CSS box model is: content, padding, border and margin.</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website.</li>
        <li>Control Flow: is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
        <li>Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
          <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
          <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable: let myVariable;</li>
        <li>Variables may hold values that have different data types:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>String: let myVariable = 'Bob';</li>
          <li>Number: let myVariable = 12;</li>
          <li>Boolean: let myVariable = true;</li>
          <li>Array: let myVariable = [1, 'Bob', 'Steve', 10];</li>
          <li>Object: let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1'); note: can be anything, including any of the above</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. Surrond with /* comment */</li>
        <li>Operator: is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
        <li>Conditionals: code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
        <li>Functions: a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.</li>
        <li>Events: Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the mouse "click" event.</li>
