# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

A webpage that contains information pertaining to the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. It was created for a student to keep notes on various topics for future access and will provide quick reference to the information via any browser. This site provides one convenient place to store various notes taken during the prework study course. During the creation of the webpage I was able to execute and practice 3 core programming languages and utilize the Git workflow to understand how projects are created and managed throughout the development process.
